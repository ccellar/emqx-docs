# Access Control

This chapter will introduce how to configure the access control policies in EMQX, covering the following topics:

- [Authentication ](../advanced/auth.md) and [Authorization](../advanced/acl.md)

  Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client. It is an essential part of most applications and can help to protect our services from illegal client connections. EMQX supports several authentication mechanisms to better protect our clients, including username/password authentication,  JWT authentication, and enhanced authentication of MQTT 5.0

  While authorization refers to the permission control over the publish/subscribe operation of the MQTT clients. This chapter will introduce how to use the built-in database and ACL file, or how to integrate with external systems to configure the authorization rules.

- [Black List](../advanced/blacklist.md)

  EMQX provides a blacklisting/banning functionality. System admins can block certain clients from accessing EMQX via Dashboard or HTTP API with their client ID, user name, or IP address.
